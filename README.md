The front-end development of the Intelligent Voice-Guided Navigation for the Visually Impaired system plays a pivotal role in bridging advanced navigation technology with real-world usability for individuals with visual impairments. This interface serves not only as the user’s first point of interaction with the system but also as the medium through which accessibility, responsiveness, and intuitiveness are achieved. By focusing on voice-command integration, auditory feedback mechanisms, and streamlined accessibility features, the front-end is specifically designed to address the unique challenges faced by the visually impaired during navigation.

The project’s primary ambition is to move beyond traditional map-based systems by delivering an intelligent, voice-first interface that interprets user commands, provides real-time guidance, and reacts contextually to changes in the user’s surroundings. Unlike conventional solutions, which often rely on visual maps and limited auditory prompts, this front-end system seeks to offer a seamless, fully voice-driven navigation experience. Key considerations during development include ensuring clarity of voice prompts, responsiveness to verbal input, and low latency for real-time feedback, and the minimisation of visual clutter to avoid confusion during occasional screen interactions by partially sighted users.
